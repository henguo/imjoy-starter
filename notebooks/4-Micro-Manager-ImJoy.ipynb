    "[ImJoy](https://imjoy.io) is a web framework for building interactive analysis tools. You can also use it to build easy-to-use and interactive data acquisition tool together with MicroManager.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial notebook, we will go through the steps for using ImJoy plugins with MicroManager to control your microscope interactively. \n",

    "Importantly, MicroManager (the python binding) exposes full access of your microscope to the python scripting interface, please be careful that some commands (e.g. moving the stage) may damage your hardware. Although this tutorial only involves camera control which is safe, we still recommend to disconnect your hardware and start Micro-Manager with the simulated demo devices for exploration, and only connect the hardware when you fully understand the scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When you open this Jupyter notebook, make sure you see an ImJoy icon in the toolbar in opened notebooks.\n",
